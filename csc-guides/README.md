# How to cook a PDF book out of CSC guides' web pages

## Collect material into a single page

1. Open the manual front page with Chrome browser
2. Open Chrome Dev Tools
3. Select *sources* tab, *snippets* (from *>>*), and choose *+New*
4. Paste [manuals.js](manuals.js) into the input box
5. Right-Click your new snippet from the file navigator on the left, and choose
   *Run* from the popup (takes a while as it loads all manual pages)

## Print a draft

You can print a raw PDF draft from the browser. This could be cleaned and made
presentable with some JS and CSS...

## Print a nicer book with pandoc

Install pandoc, texlive, download [graybox.tex](graybox.tex), etc., and save the
page web page (for example csc-guide.html) and asset directory (csc-guide/) with
*Save as...* from the right-click popup menu on the guide page.

Then,

```bash
pandoc -M title="CSC Computing Environment User Guide" -M author="Autogenerated from HTML pages with pandoc" -M date=$(date +%x) -M documentclass="article" -M classoption="titlepage" --toc -V papersize=a4paper -V geometry=margin=1in -H graybox.tex -o manual.pdf csc-guide.html

```
