## Geoconda

### Description

Geoconda includes Python GIS packages and enables users easily to install new Python packags for their own use. It is an alternative installation to the [GeoPython](https://research.csc.fi/-/geopython) module.

[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is a package management tool that is used to distribute and install software tools together with their dependencies. Geoconda installation is done with miniconda3, it includes **Python3**

Geoconda is a collection of python packages that facilitate the development of python scripts for geoinformatics applications. It includes following python packages (mostly the same as [GeoPython](https://research.csc.fi/-/geopython)):

*   [cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/) \- for map plotting (not included in GeoPython).
*   [descartes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/descartes) - use Shapely or GeoJSON-like geometric objects as matplotlib paths and patches.
*   **[fiona](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona)** - reads and writes spatial data files.
*   [gdal](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL) \- reads and writes spatial data files, and GDAL/OGR data manipulation tools.
*   [geoalchemy2](https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (only in geoconda/3.7) - provides extensions to [SQLAlchemy](http://sqlalchemy.org) for working with spatial databases, primarly PostGIS.
*   **[geopandas](http://geopandas.org/)** - GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by [pandas.](http://pandas.pydata.org)
*   [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) \- for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
*   [pyproj](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj?) - performs cartographic transformations and geodetic computations.
*   **[pysal](http://pysal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** \- spatial analysis functions.
*   [osmnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) (only in geoconda/3.7) - download spatial geometries and construct, project, visualize, and analyze street networks from OpenStreetMap's APIs.
*   **[rasterio](https://mapbox.github.io/rasterio/)** - access to geospatial raster data.
*   [rasterstats](http://pythonhosted.org/rasterstats/) - for summarizing geospatial raster datasets based on vector geometries. It includes functions for zonal statistics and interpolated point queries.
*   [rtree](http://toblerity.org/rtree/) - spatial indexing and search.
*   [shapely](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely) - manipulation and analysis of geometric objects in the Cartesian plane.
*   [skimage](http://scikit-image.org/) \- algorithms for image processing.
*   [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (only in geoconda/3.7) - machine learning for Python.
*   [laspy](https://github.com/laspy/laspy) - reading and writing .las and .laz files.
*   [pyfor](https://github.com/brycefrank/pyfor) - lidar analysis for forestry purposes.
*   And many more, for retrieving the full list in Taito use:     conda list

Additionally geoconda includes:

*   [spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/) \- Scientific PYthon Development EnviRonment with graphical interface (similar to RStudio for R). If you want to use Spyer, you should connect to taito-shell using [\-X connection or NoMachine for Windows users](https://research.csc.fi/csc-guide-connecting-the-servers-of-csc).
*   GDAL/OGR commandline tools and proj
*   And many more, see /appl/earth/geoconda/miniconda3/bin for full list.

Python has also packages for parallel computing, for example **multiprocessing**. In our examples there is two cases using Python multiprocessing: [zonal statistics](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/zonal_stats) and [focal mean](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/focal_mean).

If you want to use Python2, see also [GeoPython](https://research.csc.fi/-/geopython) module.

Geoconda can not be used simultaneously with [geo-env](https://research.csc.fi/-/geo-env) (GeoPython) module

(If you think that some important GIS package for Python is missing from here, you can ask for installation from servicedesk@csc.fi.)

### Available

##### Version on CSC's Servers

Taito: 3.6, 3.7 (version number is the same as Python version)

* * *

### Usage

**1\. Using packages installed by CSC**

To use software environments that are installed to Taito using Conda (either by CSC or yourself),Â  first load geoconda module:

    module load geoconda

This loads latest geoconda module. If you want a specific version you can do:

    module load geoconda/VERSION

After that you can use Python with GIS packages as with [GeoPython.](https://research.csc.fi/-/geopython)

For using the Spyder IDE give:

    spyder

**2\. Adding more Python packages to packages included in GeoConda**

You can add more packages to your own use, the details can be found from [Python](https://research.csc.fi/-/python) documention.

The packages are installed to your home directory under     .local/lib/python3.6 or .local/lib/python3.7

The packages installed for GeoPython are not available together with GeoConda Python because of different Python versions.

**3\. Installing software for your own use with geoconda**

You can use the geoconda module to install software to your personal Conda environments. Please see [Conda environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#) documentation for details and CSC [Bioconda](https://research.csc.fi/-/bioconda) documentation for example. The personal Conda environment does not include software included in GeoConda environment. The software is installed to:

    /wrk/your_user_name/DONOTREMOVE/geoconda3_env
