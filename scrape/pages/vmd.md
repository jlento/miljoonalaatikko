### Usage

### License

Using VMD at CSC is free for all use as detailed in the [License agreeement in here](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/LICENSE.html).

Initialize with

    module load vmd

start using with

    vmd

Note, that you need remote graphics to work with VMD. We recommend using the [NoMachine remote desktop](/-/nomachine) to that end. For almost all cases the best option is to use [taito-shell](/taito-shell-user-guide) and run VMD jobs interactively there.
