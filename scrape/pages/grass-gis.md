## GRASS GIS

### Description

GRASS GIS, commonly referred to as GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System), is a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps production, spatial modeling, and visualization.

GRASS GIS has limited support forÂ [Parallel GRASS jobs](http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Parallel_GRASS_jobs). Also some [script examples](http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Parallelizing_Scripts) of running several GRASS jobs in parallel are available. [PyGRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass75/manuals/libpython/pygrass.modules.interface.html?highlight=parallelmodulequeue#pygrass.modules.interface.module.ParallelModuleQueue) includes also ParallelModuleQueue for parallel computing, see our example about [that](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/grass_multiprocessing_with_python).

### Available

### Usage

If you want to use GRASS GUI, you should connect to taito-shell using [\-X connection or NoMachine for Windows users](https://research.csc.fi/csc-guide-connecting-the-servers-of-csc).

First load appropriate module. There are three options for that:

1) If you want to use GRASS GUI, you can open GRASS from NoMachine's Fluxbox menu (right-click to open): Applications -> Taito-shell -> GIS -> GRASS-GIS. This loads in the background the same modules as option 2.

2) If you want to use GRASS as stand-alone or with Python, use [geo-env](https://research.csc.fi/-/geo-env), which includes **Python** with GIS packages, GDAL, QGIS and LasTools.  It does not include GRASS GIS directly, but GRASS can be easily added like this:

    module load geo-env grass

3) If you want to use GRASS GIS with R, without GRASS GUI, use [rspatial-env](https://research.csc.fi/-/rspatial-env),which includes **R**, GDAL, GRASS and SagaGIS.

    module load rspatial-env

Both of the xx-env modules unload all previously loaded modules, so they should be loaded first, if you need to load also some other modules.

\* SagaGIS and GRASS GIS use different versions of wxwidgets library, which is used for the GUI. So if you would like to use both GUIs please open two sessions to Taito-shell.

Then for starting the GRASS GUI:

    grass72

It is possible to also use GRASS functionality via command-line, shell scripts or Python code, see [GRASS manual](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/grass7.html) for details.
