# 1.4 Projects and resources {#projects-and-resources .western style="page-break-before: always;"}

One  of  the  core  principles  of CSC  resource  allocation  is  that
resources  are granted  for  projects,  not users.  Every  user has  a
*Personal Group*.  It is meant for initial testing of CSC services and
has a  small amount  of computing resources.  When the  resources have
been used,  testing is  over. The  Personal Group  is not  closed, but
remains as a spare project, for the case where the person doesn't have
any other projects.

Use of  CSC's extended  services, such as  computing and  data storage
services, requires  opening a new  CSC project or joining  an existing
project.  A CSC project can be  an *Academic Project* or a *Commercial
Project*. A  CSC project is  by default  granted an initial  quota for
computing. When  the resources  run out,  more can  be applied  for or
purchased.  Academic  Projects  and Commercial  Projects  can  contain
several users  as members. The  resources granted for the  project are
shared between all project members.

Whether you  should have an  Academic Project or a  Commercial Project
depends on two  things: the *scope of research*  and the *affiliations
of the members*:

-   If  the planned research is  of academic nature where  the results
    are  published,  and **all**  the  project  members will  be  from
    universities or  polytechnics, the  Academic Project is  the right
    project type to open.
-   If the  planned research is not of academic  nature, or **any** of
    the  project  members  will   be  from  other  organizations  than
    universities or polytechnics, the  Commercial Project is the right
    project type to open. Read more on  [Customer agreements].

 

## [][1]1.4.1 Opening an academic CSC project and inviting members {#opening-an-academic-csc-project-and-inviting-members .western}

To open  a new  *Academic CSC Project*,  sign in to  SUI and  open the
[*Resources and Applications*] tool.

The person who opens the  project will become the project's *Principal
Investigator*  (PI). The  PI acts  as  the primary  contact person  in
communications  with CSC.  The PI  should be  a university  professor,
research  director  of  a  polytechnic,  or  a  similar  senior  level
researcher   fulfilling    the   [prerequisites   for    a   Principal
Investigator]. Only the PI can add or remove project members.

In  the  [Resources  and Applications][*Resources  and  Applications*]
tool, choose *Project* and *Academic  CSC Project* under the Resources
menu  to   create  a  project  application.   The  *Application  Form*
opens. Fill in all necessary information for a new project. Compulsory
fields are marked with a star.

You can  add users  to the project  at start, or  you can  invite them
later.  To  add them at  start, fill in  their email addresses  in the
field *Project  Members*. The  users must  be from  a university  or a
polytechnic.

When finished, acknowledge  that you have read and  accept the General
Terms of Use. Then submit the form. When the project has been created,
you  will  receive  an   email  notification  containing  the  project
information.

The invited members receive a notification  via email and are asked to
approve  the  project  membership  on   the  *Approvals*  tab  on  the
*Resources and Applications* page. The members need to register as CSC
customers before they can join the  project. This is instructed in the
notification email the users will  receive. When a member approves the
membership, a notification email is sent to the project's PI.

## [][3]1.4.2 Adding computing resources (Taito, Sisu, cPouta) {#adding-computing-resources-taito-sisu-cpouta style="text-align: justify;"}

When the  new project has  been established,  the PI adds  the desired
computing  resources (Taito,  Sisu  or cPouta)  for  the project.  All
project members get  access to the resource provided  that they accept
the required terms and conditions.

Sign in to SUI and open the [*Resources and Applications*] tool.

Select Computing,  and then Taito supercluster,  Sisu supercomputer or
cPouta cloud service. Please note that each computing resource must be
added <span lang="en">separately. </span>

The  figure  below shows  the  Sisu  supercomputer application.  After
selecting the resource, an application  form opens. The PI selects the
project,  accepts the  required terms  and conditions,  and sends  the
form.  The project  members will receive requests to  accept the terms
and conditions for the selected resource.  Also the PI gets access, in
this example for Sisu.

project. Taito supercluster has been added earlier.

 

## [][5]1.4.3 Changing billing project {#changing-billing-project .western}

After joining a CSC project,  please change your *billing project* for
computing  since  the Personal  groups  are  not meant  for  extensive
computing.

The billing project can be changed in SUI with the [My Projects tool].
Select the project which you want  to become your new billing project.
Then choose "Set As Billing Project" below the project list. A confirm
window opens. Press "Yes" to approve the change.

![][6]

**Figure:** Changing the billing project  to be a CSC project, instead
of the Personal group.

The billing  project changes on Taito  and Sisu the next  time you log
in.  If you  are already logged in,  you need to log out  and log back
in.  Other  services (ePouta,  cPouta,  Ida,  Kaivos, Rahti)  are  not
affected.

## [][7]1.4.4 Adding members and updating project properties {#adding-members-and-updating-project-properties .western}

If the project members were not listed when the project was opened, or
a new member joins  to the project later, the PI   can add new project
members. The PI  can also remove members from the  project when a user
leaves. (Commercial Projects are managed  by CSC, so you cannot invite
members to  them. Please contact  the [CSC  Service Desk] in  case you
need to add a new member to a Commercial Project or remove an existing
one.)

The  PI of  an  Academic Project  can  add or  remove  members at  the
Scientist's User Interface.  Sign in to SUI and open  the [My Projects
tool]. First select the project you  want to modify. Then choose *Edit
Project* in the bottom right corner.

![][8]

**Figure:** Editing project properties in the My Projects tool.

The Edit  Project tool  opens. With  this tool you  can add  or remove
users  from  the project  and  change  the project's  description  and
science area.  For other changes, for instance extending your project,
please contact the [CSC Service Desk]

![][9]

**Figure:** Project PI will invite a new users to the project with the
*invite members* function of the *edit Project* tool.

To add a new  project member, fill in the email  address of the person
to be invited to the field  next to the *Invite Member* button. Submit
the  invitation by  clicking  the button.  The users  must  be from  a
university   or  a   polytechnic.  The   invited  members   receive  a
notification via email and are asked to approve the project membership
on the *Approvals*  tab on the *Resources and  Applications* page. The
members need  to register as  CSC customers  before they can  join the
project. This is  instructed in the notification email  the users will
receive. When a  member approves the membership,  a notification email
is sent to the project's PI.

If you are not able to manage your computing project or apply for more
resources the reason may be that the link between HAKA and CSC account
can be  missing. This is common  for accounts created before  2016. If
you are not sure  if this linking is done, sign  in to the Scientist's
User Interface using the  HAKA Login. If you can see  your name on the
top of  the page (right  side), then the  linking is already  done. If
not, use the  [Add Services] tool to link your  HAKA account with your
CSC account.

the project  membership.This is  done with the  eService/Resources and
Applications page of the Scientists user intrface.
