# 1.2 Getting access to CSC services

Getting access to CSC services is normally a process that contains two
steps:

-   [**Registering as a CSC customer (below)**]
-    [**Joining to  a computing  project  or opening  a new  computing
    project (Chapter 1.4)**]

 

Registration process depends on which  type of organization you belong
to.

-   Users from *Finnish universities and polytechnics* can register as
    a  CSC  customer  by  filling  in a  [registration  form]  on  the
    Scientist's User Interface (see below).
-   Users from *foreign universities and polytechnics* can register as
    a CSC  customer if they are  in close co-operation with  a Finnish
    research group, and if the research is lead by this Finnish group.
    Applications for  [user accounts  for researchers  working abroad]
    are considered by the CSC  Resource Allocation Group in three week
    intervals.
-   Users from *other organizations* and non-academic researchers need
    to make a [customer agreement] with CSC to become a CSC customer.

When registering, the  new uses agree to follow the  *General Terms of
Use* (see the links below) when using the CSC computing services:

-   [General Terms of Use for CSC's Services for Science]
-   [CSC:n tieteen palveluiden yleiset käyttöehdot]   

Accompanied  with your  newly created  user  account, you  will get  a
*Personal Project*,  which has access  to many CSC  services. However,
the  computing quota  and other  resources are  quite limited.  To get
access to more services and more resources, an *Academic Project* or a
*Commercial Project* need to be opened (see [chapter 1.4][**Joining to
a  computing  project or  opening  a  new computing  project  (Chapter
1.4)**]).

## [][1]1.2.1 Registration as an academic user {#registration-as-an-academic-user .western}

Academic researchers  working in  Finland can register  as a  CSC user
using the Scientist's User Interface (SUI):

**[* *Register as a new CSC user][registration form]**

The  link above  opens the  entry page  of Scientist's  User Interface
shown in Figure  1.1. The registration process is  started by clicking
the  HAKA button.  After  this  you need  to  select  first your  home
organization from  the drop-down menu and  authenticate yourself using
your home  organization's username and password.  If your organization
is not shown in the dropdown  menu of organizations, or the HAKA Login
doesn't work, please contact the [CSC Service Desk].

If you  are entering to  the Scientists  User Interface for  the first
time, you  will be automatically  guided to a  Sign Up form  where you
need to  define the information  that is used  to create your  new CSC
user  account.  Please  fill in  the  Sign Up  form carefully  (Figure
1.2.). The email address you give should be the email address provided
by your home  organization. Please do not use gmail  or other external
email addresses here.

You also need to assign a password for your CSC account. Please ensure
that  you are  setting a  proper  password as  instructed in  [Chapter
1.2.2.]

Interface.

Once the registration form is filled  an submitted, you new account is
created in  a few minutes and  an announcement about your  account  is
sent to the email address you provided.

 

## [][4]1.2.2 CSC username and password {#csc-username-and-password .western}

To  be  able to  connect  to  CSC computing  servers  you  need a  CSC
*username*  and  a *password*.  The  CSC  username is  permanent   and
assigned by CSC.  The  password is set by the user and  it needs to be
updated at least  once a year. You will receive  an email notification
when your  password is expiring.  Please note  that if you  do **not**
change your  password in  30 days after  the notification,   your user
account will be closed.

Normally you assign  your first CSC password in the  Sign Up form when
you register as a new CSC customer ([Chapter 1.2.1][**Registering as a
CSC  customer  (below)**]).  After  that you  can  maintain  your  CSC
password with the following tools:

-   If  you know your  CSC username  and password, please  update your
    password in SUI using the [My Account tool].
-    If you  remember your  CSC  username, you  can assign  a new  CSC
    password in SUI by clicking on the [Forgot Password link].
-   If you have questions about your CSC user name, please contact the
    [CSC Service Desk].

The CSC password should meet the following requirements:

-    Use minimum  of eight  (8) characters  (A-Z,a-z,0-9). No  special
    characters allowed
-   Use  at least one (1)  uppercase letter, one (1)  lowercase letter
    and one (1) number
-   No special characters allowed
-   Do not use email address as a password
-   Do not use words/names/abbreviations in any language
-   Do not reuse your current password

 

## [][5]1.2.3 Forgot Password {#forgot-password style="text-align: justify;"}

 If you  remember your  CSC username,  you can  assign a  new password
using  the  *Forgot password  link*  on  the  [Sign  in page]  of  the
Scientist's  User Interface.  Click on  the Forgot  Password link  and
follow the instructions.

**Figure 1.3** Forgot password link in the Scientist's User Interface.

You will receive an email with  subject: ‘CSC - Setting a new password
/ Uuden  salasanan asettaminen'  with a personal  link. Click  on  the
link and set a new password. The changed password is propagated to all
CSC servers and services within few minutes.

## [][7]1.2.4 Changing user information with My Account tool {#changing-user-information-with-my-account-tool .western}

You can  view and edit your  contact details and other  information at
the [Scientist's User  Interface]. When signed in, click  your name on
the upper right corner. The My Account page opens. You can also change
your password there.
