# 5. Moving data between CSC and local environment {#moving-data-between-csc-and-local-environment style="margin-bottom: 0in;"}

The  disk environment  of  CSC allows  user to  deal  with very  large
datasets. However, transferring large datasets  to CSC can take a long
time. Data transfer performance  depends mostly on available bandwidth
and distance  or latency of  the connection. Recent  operating systems
have automatic TCP  buffer tuning feature that  improves data transfer
performance.  Firewalls   and  VPN   tunnels  may   cause  performance
degradation.  Transferring  a 1  GB  file  to  or from  CSC  computing
environment should usually  not take more than a minute  or two if the
organization's network  is connected  to Funet.  Contact the  local IT
support in case of problems.
