# 1.1. Notation used in this guide {#notation-used-in-this-guide .western}

In this guide, the **boldface** font is used indicate a command or
parameter, that is appearing for the first time in the normal text of a
chapter. For example: "Use command **ls** to see the content of a
directory". After the first appearance commands, parameters and file
names are typed with *italic* font. Italic font is also used to
introduce new terms within the text.  
  
To emphasize how to write a command the courier font in a grey box is
used. For example: Use following command to log in to the taito.csc.fi
cluster:

    ssh taito.csc.fi

Generic arguments given to commands are indicated with an italic font.
For example:

    rm file

In the command examples the output is also displayed within a grey box.
For example Command

    ls

gives following results

    file1
    file2

Some examples use a notation where both command and the results are in
the same box. In these cases the command prompt is shown and the actual
command is displayed with **bold face** letters. For example:

    kkayttaj@taito:~> ls
    file1
    file2

Note that here the command prompt ( e.g. kkayttaj@taito:~&gt; ) is not
part of the command.
