## VMD

### Description

Biomolecular visualization and modeling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Available

##### Version on CSC's Servers

Taito: 1.9.1, 1.9.3

Sisu: 1.9.1, 1.9.3

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Usage

### License

Using VMD  at CSC  is free  for all  use as  detailed in  the [License
agreeement in here].

Initialize with

`module load vmd`

start using with

`vmd`

Note, that  you need remote  graphics to  work with VMD.  We recommend
using the [NoMachine remote desktop] to that end. For almost all cases
the best option is to use [taito-shell] and run VMD jobs interactively
there.

### Discipline

Biosciences  
Chemistry  
Visualization

### References

Proper  citation  is  essential  to  continued  NIH  funding  for  VMD
development, as it is a primary  way in which we demonstrate the value
of  our software  to  the  scientific community.  Thank  you for  your
attention to these details.
