### Description

### License

Since 2016 CSC  has had a site license that  provides unlimited access
to the Materials  Studio, including MDol3, for  researchers in Finnish
universities.  Also read  the  end user  agreement  from Biovia  page:
<http://www.3dsbiovia.com/about/legal/user-agreements.html>

DMol<sup>3</sup>  is   a  unique,   accurate,  and   reliable  density
functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanical module in [Materials Studio
Modeling]
for research in the chemicals and pharmaceutical industries.  
Combines computational  speed with the accuracy  of quantum mechanical
methods  to predict  materials properties  both reliably  and quickly.
Extremely versatile and can be applied to research problems in the gas
phase, solvent, and solid state, in chemistry, materials science,
chemical engineering, and solid state physics.  
See a [list of  case studies] at the Accelrys web  site to learn about
the capabilities of DMol<sup>3</sup>.
