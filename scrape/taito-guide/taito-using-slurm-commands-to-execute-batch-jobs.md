# 3.2 Using SLURM commands to execute batch jobs

The basic SLURM commands for submitting batch jobs are **[][1]sbatch**
that submits jobs to batch job system and **[][2]scancel** that can be
used to stop and remove a queueing or a running job. The basic syntax of
the *sbatch* command is:

    sbatch -options batch_job_file

Normally the *sbatch* options are included in the batch job file, but
you can use the options listed in Table 3.1, in command line too. For
example:

    sbatch -J test2 -t 00:05:00 batch_job_file.sh

If the same option is used both in command line and in the batch job
file, the value defined in the command line overrides the value in the
batch job file. When the job is successfully launched, the command
prints out a line, telling the *ID number* of the submitted job. For
example:

    Submitted batch job 6594 

The job ID number can be used to follow the progress of the job or to
remove it. For example, a job with ID 6594 can be removed from the batch
job system with command:

    scancel 6594

The number of jobs, that a single user can have in the batch job system
of Taito at once, has been limited to 896, to prevent batch job system
from overloading.

Progress of the submitted batch jobs can be followed with commands
*squeue, sjstat* and *sacct*. These commands can also be used to check
the status and parameters of the batch job environment. *squeue,
sjstat *<span
style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 19.0909px; text-align: justify;">and </span>*sacct
usage *examples are given below.

By default [][3]<span style="font-style: normal">**squeue**</span>
command lists all the jobs which are submitted to the SLURM scheduler.
If you want to see status of your own jobs only, you can use command:

    squeue -l -u username

or

    squeue -l -u $USER

You can also check the status of a specific job by defining the
**jobid** with **-j** switch. Using option **-p** ***partition*** will
display only jobs on that SLURM partition.

Command [][4]**scontrol** allows to view SLURM configuration and state.
To check when the job waiting in the queue will be executed, the command
**scontrol show job** ***jobid*** can be used. A row *"StartTime=..."*
gives an estimate on the job start-up time. It may happen that the job
execution time can not be approximated, in which case *"StartTime=
Unknown"*. Note, that the "StartTime" may change, e.g., be shortened, as
the time goes.

The **[sacct]** command can be used to study the log file of the batch
job system. Thus it can show information about both active jobs and jobs
that have already finished. By default the *sacct* command shows
information about users' own jobs. The *<span
style="font-weight: normal">sacct</span>* command has a wide selection
of options and parameters that can be used to select the data to be
displayed. By default *sacct* displays information from the time period
that starts from the midnight of current day. You can change the
starting date with option **-S** ***YYYY-MM-DD***. For example, to list
the information since first of February 2015 you can use command:

    sacct -S 2015-02-01

Information about specific jobs can be checked with option
**-J ***job-ID*. For example detailed information about job number 6594
could be shown with command:

    sacct -S 2013-02-01 -j 6594 -l 

Quite often the full listing of the job information is not desirable. To
choose only specific information, you can use option **-o** combined
with the list of fields to display. For example:

    [kkayttaj@taito-login4~]$ sacct -j 6594 -o MaxRSS,AveRSS,ReqMem,Elapsed,AllocCPUS
        MaxRSS     AveRSS     ReqMem    Elapsed AllocCPUS
    ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------
                              2347Mc   02:01:49         4
      3480116K   3480116K     2347Mc   02:01:49         1

In the example above, the listing shows that job 6594 used 3.5 GB
(3480116 KB) of memory and lasted 2 hours, 1 minute and 49 seconds. This
information could then be used to optimize batch job parameters for
other similar jobs.

When a batch job has finished it is good to run **seff** command to
check the efficiency of your job. The syntax of the *seff* command is:

~~~~
  seff jobid
~~~~

A sample session below shows a case where a job (job\_id: 54321) took 49
min and 19 s and used the reserved CPU-resources rather efficiently
(98.68% efficiency). In the cases of memory, nearly 40 GB was reserved
but  only bit over 4 GB was used in maximum. Thus for a second similar
job, the user should consider decreasing the memory reservation.

    [kkayttaj@taito-login4~] seff 54321
    Job ID: 54321
    Cluster: csc
    User/Group: kayttaj/somegroup
    State: COMPLETED (exit code 0)
    Cores: 1
    CPU Utilized: 00:48:40
    CPU Efficiency: 98.68% of 00:49:19 core-walltime
    Memory Utilized: 4.06 GB
    Memory Efficiency: 10.39% of 39.06 GB
