# 1.4 Monitoring the load in Taito

<span style="line-height: 1.4; text-align: left;">Server information,
current CPU load, CPU load history and job count history of Taito
supercluster and other CSC's servers can be checked with *Host Monitor*
tool of CSC's *Scientist's User Interface* web portal. In addition,
signing in offers additional features such as details of all running
batch jobs:</span>

-   [Host Monitor (CSC account required, full access)]
-   [Host Monitor (no authentication, limited functionality)]

Once you have logged in to Taito, you can check load status also with
commands:

    squeue

and

    sinfo

These commands and tools show the jobs that are currently running or
waiting in the batch job system.
