## 6.2 Getting access to Taito-GPU {#getting-access-to-taito-gpu style="text-align: justify;"}

In order to access Taito-GPU you need to login to **taito-gpu.csc.fi**
system first. Only that system currently provides you access to the
appropriate module environments (e.g. CUDA-environment and CUDA-aware
MPI libraries, and PGI-compiler for OpenACC) to build & launch your GPU
application. Please see further sections for how to select the correct
modules, how to compile your application and how to run it.
