# 4. Storage in Pouta

There is at least one type of storage available on every virtual
machine: the file system defined by the virtual machine image. This is
the primary disk of the virtual machine. In addition, it may have a
certain amount of additional local disk space called **ephemeral
storage** in OpenStack terminology defined by the flavor. This storage
is visible on the machine as a second hard disk.

This storage is only available for as long as you run the machine. When
you terminate the machine, the data is lost. You should not store any
persistent data here, and the storage should not be considered reliable.
For persistent storage you can use volumes and Object storage which are
introduced in Chapters 4.2 and 4.3.
