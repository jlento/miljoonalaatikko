## 4.4.1 Pouta Object Storage Benefits

Object storage is generally used for a different purpose that many other
storage solutions. It has benefits but also limitations. These are some
of the benefits, but once you start using it, you are bound to find
more.

-   You do not need to set up a virtual machine to serve or receive the
    data.
-   The data can be accessed from anywhere using the same URL.
-   The data can have different levels of access control.

### Limitations

-   Object storage can't be properly mounted on virtual machines. There
    are some tools to help this, but they have their limitations. For
    example svfs can be used to mount swift as filesystem but it uses
    FUSE which is slow.
-   Unsuitable for objects/files that change during their lifetime (e.g.
    most databases).
