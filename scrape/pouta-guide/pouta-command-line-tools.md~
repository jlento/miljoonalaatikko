## 3.4 Command line client tools

You can do most of the things you need from the OpenStack (Horizon) web
interface of cPouta and ePouta. However, sometimes it's handier, or even
necessary to use command line tools. OpenStack is divided into
subcomponents that each take care of some specific task like managing
virtual machines, volumes or images. Each of these subcomponents has its
own API which can be accessed either programmatically or from a terminal
using the command line tools that are introduced in this chapter. 

The command line tools are used to control your use of the service, so
they should be installed either on your local laptop/desktop or another
server which you will use to manage the service.
