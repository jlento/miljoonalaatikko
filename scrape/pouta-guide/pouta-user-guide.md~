## Pouta User Guide

cPouta and ePouta are the IaaS clouds services at CSC. The cPouta cloud
is the public cloud which is easily accessible via the internet. The
ePouta cloud is virtual private cloud designed to meet the security
requirements for handling sensitive data.  Both cPouta and ePouta
clouds run on OpenStack cloud software. The Pouta cloud services are
suitable for most kinds of computational workloads, and any other
supporting services these workloads might need.

cPouta virtual machines can be connected to the external IP addresses,
and in this case they can be directly accessed from the Internet. This
helps the customers run widely available services, but customers must
also take care to secure their machines. The virtual machines do not
have access to any other part of CSC's infrastructure, other than what
is already visible to the Internet. Application data and software must
be uploaded either via the internet or copied from CSC's existing shared
storage services.  
  
ePouta cloud services are well suited for computational workloads
involving sensitive data as well as extending customer's existing IT
infrastructure. ePouta cloud services are attached to customer's
infrastructure and could be used to analyse sensitive data which may
require large amounts of memory or clustered I/O performance, remote
desktop for processing of sensitive data etc.. The virtual machines in
ePouta cloud may optionally have network access to specific sensitive
data repositories at CSC.
