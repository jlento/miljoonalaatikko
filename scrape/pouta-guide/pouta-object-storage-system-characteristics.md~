## 4.4.2 System Characteristics

The object storage service stores "objects". These are blobs of data,
and can be anything. In general you can think of objects as files.  
  
The data objects are stored in containers (or buckets). These containers
should not be confused with Docker, or other containers used for
computing. A container basically acts like a filesystem directory, but
you can have only one level of them, so you cannot have containers
within containers.  
  
Each container has a name, which must be unique across all users. So if
somebody else has a container called "test" you can not create a
container called "test". All container names are public, so please do
not put private information in the container name. URLs to objects can
be in DNS format: https://containername.object.pouta.csc.fi - for this
reason using a valid DNS name ([RFC 1035]) for the container makes
things easier. Specifically we recommend not using upper case characters
in the container name.  
  
Data objects within the containers are immutable once they have been
uploaded. You can delete an object and upload a new one with the same
name, but you can't do changes to it.  
  
There are three copies of the data you store in the service. These
copies are spread across different servers. This protects the data
against disk and server failures. Please note that this does not protect
from e.g. accidental deletion, and you should still make backups of
important data.
